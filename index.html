<p>
  We usually play at "SharkPark" (the multi-use courts across the Guadalupe River from the SAP center,
  so between SAP center and the 87 along Santa Clara street).
  You can sneak a prius around the side of the gate on the south side and park next to the court,
  or, you know, actually ride your damn bike.

<h3>
  What is bike polo?
</h3>

<p>
  A really dumb game that is totally fun.
  I mean it's absurd, but the way the bicycles circle around and paths fold and branch out,
  it's the next best thing from bombing down through traffic on 5th ave manhattan - and a lot safer.
  Also a good excuse to break bikes, fix bikes, and hang out.

  Bike polo people tend to be pretty open to anyone who wants to show up, shout, criticize, participate,
  exalt, educate, pontificate, whatever. Just don't be an asshole.
  Pretty open to just about anyone, except nazis. 
  No nazis, no ethno-nationalists, no eugenicists, no transphobes, no racists. None of that.

<h3>
  What do I need for polo?
</h3>

<p>
  If you're new, get in contact with us and we can bring a loaner bike and mallet.
  Contact how?
  Not a problem. Sometimes we'll bring it just in case.
</p>

<p>
  If you're playing a lot, you'll probably want to get your own though..
  Although some folks will try to sell you or sell you on fancy gear,
  and the fancy gear is nice, 
  you can have a lot of fun on a moutain bike or something.
  Pick something with a good brake and a low gear. 
  You gotta make sure it's safe as possible, so no exposed
  disk brakes or single gears without chains on them. 
  No extraneous sharp bits, big chainrings
  should be covered up. You'll also need a mallet. You can buy
  those online, or make one from a ski pole, 2" gas pipe, a hex nut, and a long
  hex bolt with a low/recessed head. We'll show you how.
